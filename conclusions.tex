\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

In this paper, we have presented \texttt{z3.rkt}, which lets users interact
with an SMT solver programmatically. We have demonstrated through examples
the simplicity and usefulness of such an interaction. The power of
\texttt{z3.rkt} comes from the facilities provided by Racket to build
abstractions on top of the SMT-solving capabilities of Z3. From the user's
perspective, the integration is seamless and fully transparent.

Our implementation is open source and freely available at

\end{center}

\texttt{z3.rkt} is still a work in progress, and we hope to soon achieve the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Support more Z3 constructs, including bit-vectors and external theories
\item Derive new abstractions guided by practical use cases
\item Possibly integrate with other SMT solvers
\end{itemize}

In the long term, we hope the community will find this system useful and will
contribute to the project to solve large practical problems.
